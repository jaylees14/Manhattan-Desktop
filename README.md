# Blueprint

Blueprint was created as part of the COMS30400 Group Project unit at the University of Bristol.</br>
This repository holds the main *desktop* application used for playing Blueprint.

## Game Outline
It is a game inspired by Minecraft and Pok√©mon Go, where the player finds themselves stranded on a distant planet, but discovers blueprints for building a communication beacon. 
In order to return home safely, they must build a communication beacon and signal for help using components and machines built from the discovered blueprints. 
However, there is a catch! The raw resources required to progress through the game cannot be collected on the desktop app - the player must log off and venture outside into the real world with the mobile app, and Hololens if available where they are presented with a map showing nearby raw resources the player can collect. 
Once the player is close enough to a resource, it will enable an Augmented Reality game to collect some quantity of the resource, determined by the players performance in the game.
Utilising the cloud, we synchronise the entire game remotely - allowing the player to seamlessly pick up where the left off, from any internet connected device.
The end goal is simple: build each of the blueprints one by one until you have the resources to rebuild the communication beacon. 

## Technology Outline
- The project was built from scratch using Unity, using a bespoke state machine for storing and manipulating progress through the game.
- This state was stored remotely, using the associated [Cloud Server](https://github.com/manhattan-blueprint/Manhattan-Server).
- All of the 3D and 2D design elements used in the game were completely bespoke and created by members of the team.
- The accompanying soundtrack and sound effects were developed by Pablo Mogollon.
