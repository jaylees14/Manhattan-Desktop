## Story
On a routine solo trip from planet to planet across your home galaxy, your ship suddenly loses power. Drifting through space with no means of communicating your ship is pulled into the gravitational field of a nearby planet and your ship begins to plummet to the surface...

You awaken on the shore of a large lake, you must have passed out during descent on account of the G-forces. Your ship is a wreck but you are seemingly uninjured, and more importantly alive...

Your helmet, so designed to help you survive in alien atmosphere is cracked but you are breathing fine. This atmosphere must be highly similar to that of your home planet. Stepping out onto the shore and scanning the distant horizon you spot a large, dome-like structure, breaking through the trees around it. You see no other choice but to journey to the dome...

Entering the dome you are greeted with silence. The dome's walls stand firm, the glass panes whole and no tell of how long this space had been abandoned, if it truly is. In the centre of the dome, in the shadow of a large metal frame, lay scattered pages, arranged in some order and yet clearly strewn in a hurried fashion.

Taking one page from its resting place, you realise these are blueprints! Carefully placing the page back in its place and inspecting each other in turn, repeating the same process, you find blueprints ranging from the most primitive of tool to machines beyond your understanding... Why are these here? What is this place?...

Game begins...
